# Music Tabs (name is a WIP)
This project is to allow easy editing of music.

## Building
### C#
Use the dotnet CLI for the best experience; a simple `dotnet watch` is enough to start the server.

### JavaScript
I use Parcel as an easy JavaScript bundler, and I have created a utility script in the wwwroot folder to watch changes:

`npm run watch`

which will automatically bundle any changes made to .js files in the `wwwroot/js` folder.
